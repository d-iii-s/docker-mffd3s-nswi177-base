\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
 In Flanders fields the poppies blow \\
Between the crosses, row on row, \\
\ind    That mark our place; and in the sky \\
\ind    The larks, still bravely singing, fly \\
Scarce heard amid the guns below. \\!

We are the Dead. Short days ago \\
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, \\
\ind    Loved and were loved, and now we lie, \\
\ind \ind        In Flanders fields. \\!

Take up our quarrel with the foe: \\
To you from failing hands we throw \\
\ind    The torch; be yours to hold it high. \\
\ind    If ye break faith with us who die \\
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow \\
\ind \ind        In Flanders fields. \\
